## 🧠 Problem Solving

Many families struggle with the performance of domestic workers due to a lack of experience and communication barriers, especially language.  
Makfoul App solves this by connecting families with experienced trainers who can help workers improve their skills in areas like cleaning and cooking.  
It also provides trainers with a way to generate additional income through the platform.
